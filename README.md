# ImpostorBaker

Added a button to render a bunch of meshes in one click.
In order to do it, put the meshes you want to render into the level, then add them to "Meshes to Convert" array in BP_Generate_ImposterSprites actor. After that click on "Make Materials And Meshes". The output Materials and Textures will be put in the "New Materials Path" directory, and new meshes will appear in "New Mesh Path" directory.
